# FASHION-BLOG
This website was created for a beginner **fashion influencer**. I've used **Gatsby.js** for it to be **optimized for search engines** and as a result the site should rank and perform better. All key data is retrieved from headless **DatoCMS**, so the author has a full control over what is on her blog.
